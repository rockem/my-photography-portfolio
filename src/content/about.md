### Hi, I'm Eli ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software architect lead based in Israel.
Iâ€™m married to Liat, and together weâ€™re raising our two wonderful kids, Ory and Shira.
Photography is my way of capturing the beauty in everyday life â€” especially the candid, unplanned moments that tell real stories.
Iâ€™m drawn to minimalism and aim for clean compositions with a clear subject and a sense of calm.
Beyond photography, Iâ€™m also a singer-songwriter, skateboarder and love to play skill toys like Kendama and Yoyo.

#### My Gear

- Leica Q3(28)
- Ricoh GR IIIx
