title: About me

### Hi, I'm Sara Richard ðŸ‘‹

I've been a photographer for over 10 years, focusing primarily on landscape and portrait photography. My journey began
with a simple point-and-shoot camera while traveling through the mountains of Colorado, which sparked a passion that has
taken me across the globe.
My approach to photography centers on finding the extraordinary in ordinary moments. I believe that beauty exists
everywhere â€“ in urban streets, remote wilderness, and human connections. My goal is to capture these fleeting instances
in a way that allows viewers to see the world through a different lens.
When I'm not behind the camera, you can find me hiking in national parks, exploring new cities, or enjoying a cup of
coffee at local cafÃ©s while planning my next photo adventure.
